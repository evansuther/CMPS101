1. README - ToC and short descriptions

2. Makefile - Provided by Tantalo, I slightly modified it, makes FindComponents executable by default.
 * can also compile GraphClient or GraphTest, clean repo and run valgrind
 
3. FindComponents.c - takes formatted input file, builds a digraph from the input,
 * prints the adjacency list representation to the output file, determines
 * the strongly connected components of the graph and prints them to the output file
 
4. Graph.h - exports the required functions of the Graph adt, along with constants NIL and UNDEF
 * and defines Graph to be a pointer to a GraphObj

5. Graph.c - stores a Graph in Adj list representation,
 * has vertex attributes for DFS for PA5 spec
 * adapted from previous Graph ADT build for BFS, mostly overhauled
 
6. List.h - header file for List.c, exports the adt operations in the spec
 * also implements optional concatList
 
7. List.c - Doubly linked list with front/back references and a cursor
 * implements required operations as well as optional concatList

8. GraphTest.c - runs a series of tests on Graph ADT implementation
 * and prints pass/fail based on what the functions should be returning/modifying
