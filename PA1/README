1. List.java - Implements List ADT spec from PA1
		the structure is a doubly linked list with a front, back, and cursor
2. ListClient.java - Provided by Tantalo
3. Lex.java - Takes input file and produces sorted output file uses List
		CITATION for "String inputString = inputFile.useDelimiter("\\A").next();"
		I found the delimiter and the regex '\\A' at  https://abhinandanmk.blogspot.com/2012/05/java-how-to-read-complete-text-file.html
		I didn't know how to read a whole file as a single string, this blog had a few different ways but I stuck with the scanner method
		I learned about the scanner and File I/O  in 12B with prof. Sesh. - I'm citing this because Tantalo said google how to read a file as a string
4. Makefile - compiles and packages Lex.jar
5. README - ToC and short descriptions
